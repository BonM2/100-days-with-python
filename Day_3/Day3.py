# Day 3 I was learnt about control flow with if, else and logical operations in python

# Example: The rollercoaster
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What's your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster")
else:
    print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
