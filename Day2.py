# Day 2 I was learning about data types, mathematical operations in python

# Exercise about data types
"""two_digit_number = input("num = ")
two_digit_number = int(two_digit_number)
sum_digit = 0
while two_digit_number > 0:
    digit = two_digit_number % 10
    sum_digit += digit
    two_digit_number //= 10
print("result =", sum_digit)"""

# Exercise BMI Calculator
"""height = float(input("Height (m) = "))
weight = float(input("Weight (kg) = "))
BMI = weight / height ** 2
# Round function
print(round(BMI, 2))"""

"""score = 100
height = 1.8
isWinning = True
#f-String
print(f"your score is {score}, your height is {height}, you are winning is {isWinning}")"""

# Exercise if you live to 90 years old how many weeks you left
"""age = input()
weeks = (90 - int(age)) * 52
print(f"You have {weeks} weeks left")"""
